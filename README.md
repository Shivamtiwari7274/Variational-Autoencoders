 Utilized Keras and tensorflow library of Python to generate new images using a set of over 30,000 training images
 Constructed variational autoencoder to identify input distribution and sampled new output from same distribution
 Enhanced authenticity of output by designing suitable loss function comprising of reconstruction and KL-divergence
